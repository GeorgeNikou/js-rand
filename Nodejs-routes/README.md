## Yelp Camp Project

This project was a code along done on Udemy called web developer lesson 291 to 320. Application utlizes node.js, express, mongoose, ejs, body-parser etc.. 

Actions include: 
* create post
  * upload image/title/comment
* create account
  * username
  * password
* edit post
  * image/title/comment
 * delete post

This project remains somewhat incomplete due a loss of interest. The site still provides the very basic CRUD functionality however.
